How to run Aruco 

ArUco: Augmented Reality library from the University of Cordoba
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ArUco is a minimal C++ library for detection of Augmented Reality markers based on OpenCv exclusively.



\section LIBRARY DESCRIPTION:

The ArUco library contents are divided in two main directories. The src directory, which contains the library itself. And the utils directory which contains the applications.

The library main classes are:

   - aruco::Marker: which represent a marker detected in the image
   - aruco::MarkerDetector: that is in charge of deteting the markers in a image Detection is done by simple calling the member funcion ArMarkerDetector::detect(). Additionally, the classes contain members to create the required matrices for rendering using OpenGL. See aruco_test_gl for details
   - aruco::BoardConfiguration: A board is an array of markers in a known order. BoardConfiguracion is the class that defines a board by indicating the id of its markers. In addition, it has informacion about the distance between the markers so that extrinsica camera computations can be done.
   - aruco::Board: This class defines a board detected in a image. The board has the extrinsic camera parameters as public atributes. In addition, it has a method that allows obtain the matrix for getting its position in OpenGL (see aruco_test_board_gl for details).
   - aruco::BoardDetector : This is the class in charge of detecting a board in a image. You must pass to it the set of markers detected by ArMarkerDetector and the BoardConfiguracion of the board you want to detect. This class will do the rest for you, even calculating the camera extrinsics.


\subsection APPLICATIONS

- The library comes with five applications that will help you to learn how to use the library:
 -# aruco_create_marker: which creates marker and saves it in a jpg file you can print.
 -# aruco_simple : simple test aplication that detects the markers in an image
 -# aruco_test: this is the main application for detection. It reads images either from the camera of from a video and detect markers. Additionally, if you provide the intrinsics of the camera(obtained by OpenCv calibration) and the size of the marker in meters, the library calculates the marker intrinsics so that you can easily create your AR applications.
 -# aruco_test_gl: shows how to use the library AR applications using OpenGL for rendering
 -# aruco_create_board: application that helps you to create a board
 -# aruco_board_pix2meters: application that helps you to convert a board configuration file from pixels(as provided by aruco_create_board) to meters.
 -# aruco_test_board: application that detects boards
 -# aruco_simple_board: simple application that detects boards in an image
 -# aruco_test_board_gl: application that detects boards and uses OpenGL to draw
 
\section COMPILING THE LIBRARY:

 REQUIREMENTS: OpenCv >= 2.3.1, cmake >= 2.8


\subsection LINUX:

Go to the aruco library and do
